# Employee page

Build a employee page to show and edit the employee info. One inspirations is [Polywork](https://www.polywork.com/).

# Instructions

You only need to build a single page to display a particular employee info and allow the employee to edit the page. At the same time, please define the APIs for interaction with the backend, facilitating future expansion and third-party integration.

# Minimum Requirements

1. A UI to display the employee info.
1. Support changing the employee info.

The requirements are intentionally simple and vague, please think a bit further about what you expect the user to view and edit the employee info.

# Good to have

### Tech Stack

The tech stuch should be TypeScript, React and Tailwind CSS since that's the one you will work with after join. So you may try to get a sense beforehand.

1. Frontend - TypeScript, Reac, Tailwind CSS.
2. Backend - Go if you have pure backend background. If you have more frontend background, node is perfectly fine. It's also totally fine if your solution doesn't involve backend at all.

### Features

We don't require any additional features. If you have more time, we recommend you to polish those minimum requirements. But if you can't resist the temptation, just go ahead and surprise us.
